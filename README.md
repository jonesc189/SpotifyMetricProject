# SpotifyMetricProject
SpotifyMain.py uses different modules to get the top tracks/artists from a givenuser. Once details are printed, the user is allowed to select a track they wouldlike to play, select a artist to play, or select a random track from the top tracks. Once chosen, the desired choice is played via the active Spotify device. 

Some future add ons will be a web/GUI interface so the interaction is more user friendly. Also, I will be attaching a video demoing the code in more detail.
